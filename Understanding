Objective of the Paper:

Many say that Face Recognition is a solved problem. But the truth is the there is a large amount of gap which exists between the publicly available face recognition systems and the privately available face recognition technology. This work is directed towards reducing that accuracy gap.


Any General Face Recognition Pipeline:

Input --> Face Detection --> Preprocessing --> Low Dimensional Embedding --> Classification.


Today’s top-performing face recognition techniques are based on convolutional neural net-
works. Facebook’s DeepFace [TYRW14] and Google’s FaceNet [SKP15] systems yield the highest
accuracy. However, these deep neural network-based techniques are trained with private datasets
containing millions of social media images that are orders of magnitude larger than available
datasets for research.
